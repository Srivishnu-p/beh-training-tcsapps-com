# Caveats:
#
# This requires the "reqeusts" python module: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
#
# This is simple code for people who just want to run a friggin scan on a few IPs and want the result
# from those scans.  You won't be running any enterprise systems with this, no asset management,
# no tags and stuff.  This is not a substitute for Parag Baxi's code.  This is a simple primer.
#
# Also: There is NO error checking in this code, there is NO try catch, there is only do or do not.
#
# On the other hand, you can use this code to help understand in a simple way what all the buttons do.
